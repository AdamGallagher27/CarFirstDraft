#schedule: Holds where the NPC should be and what event should be triggered based on the time of day and day of the game.
#
#dialogues: Contains both main dialogue and small talk. If an NPC has no "main" dialogue, it will only offer "small" dialogue.
#
#completed_events: A record of events that the player has completed (prevents the same main conversation from being triggered twice).
#
#update_npc_state(): Checks the schedule based on the current game day and time. It then updates the NPC's position and decides whether it should have a main or small dialogue.
#
#interact(): Handles what happens when the player interacts with the NPC. It decides whether to show main dialogue or small talk based on the NPC's state.

#current_event_name: This is the event that determines which dialogue to trigger.
#
#event_data: The actual dialogue data for the event (either "main" or "small").
#
#Checking for main_scene: If the NPC is supposed to load a scene (e.g., a cutscene or a quest-giving screen), it checks for "main_scene" and loads that instead of displaying text.
#
#Dialogue Display: If thereâ€™s no scene, it displays the main text. If the main conversation has been completed, it falls back to small talk.
#
#completed_events[current_event_name]: Marks the event as completed after the interaction to prevent the main dialogue from triggering again.
